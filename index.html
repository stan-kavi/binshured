    <!-- Whole life insurance -->
    <h2 class="pageTitle"><span class="pixel-arrow-style"></span>Whole life insurance</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>It is permanent life insurance. It is protection that lasts your entire life. Term Insurance  only covers you for a specific number of years. A whole life policy also has a “cash value” element to  it. Therefore it becomes a life-long financial asset that has tax benefits. There is an underwriting process which often includes a medical exam. Then based on how long you are expected to live the insurance company sets four guaranteed values</p>

      <p><strong>Level premium for life:</strong> Never changes. As long as you pay the premiums the policy remains in force</p>

      <p><strong>Guaranteed death benefit:</strong> The amount paid to your beneficiaries upon death will never decrease</p>

      <p><strong>Guaranteed cash value:</strong> The cash value grows at a set rate each year until it equals the face amount of the policy at a specified age, somewhere around 100 - 121 years of age</p>

      <p><strong>A guaranteed endowment:</strong> A death benefit is guaranteed to be paid if the insured is still living at the age specified in the contract, typically age 100 or 121</p>

      <strong>You were planning on being a centurion, right?</strong>

      <p>It can take time for a while life policy to grow into a meaningful amount, but if policy premiums are kept up the cash value has a myriad of benefits that you can use while alive. At that point  you can borrow money against <strong>your own money</strong> the policy`s cash value. You can also use it to pay premiums, or even cash it in at retirement.</p>

      <p>If you purchased your policy from a mutual insurance company it can earn dividends which can increase your cash value. You can take your dividends in a myriad of ways:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Take it in cash</li>
        <li>You can reduce the premium</li>
        <li>You can buy additional insurance</li>
        <li>Accumulate additional cash value</li>
        <li>Pay down any policy loans</li>
      </ul>

      <p>While by points Whole Life Policies seem to have significant advantages consider over Term  Insurance:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You have guaranteed insurance for life</li>
        <li>You have a cash value if policy is kept</li>
        <li>Tax free benefits for the death benefit</li>
        <li>Tax deferred benefits for growth</li>
        <li>Liability Protection from creditor lawsuits</li>
        <li>Collateral for loans</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Disadvantages of Whole Life Insurance:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Affordability for  enough insurance needed</li>
        <li>Lifetime premiums and ability to keep premiums up during income interruptions</li>
        <li>The opportunity costs with mixing insurance with investments</li>
        <li>There have been a lot of changes to term insurance that can change some these disadvantages but the major issue of affordability remains.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For probably the vast overwhelming majority of Americans the best choice is a small Whole Life Policy for about a $5,000.00 - $15,000.00 Death Benefit coupled with a term policy for the remaining life insurance protection needed. If kept up the Whole Life Policy can in the end serve as a Final Expense Policy at death.</p>

      <p>Many insurance agents Promoting Final Expense Insurance are simply selling whole life policies. This works but you don’t have to do this you can just buy a pre-paid. Pre-need funeral whether it’s a cremation or traditional funeral. It just depends on your assets available to pay for a funeral now and upon your death. The case to at least buy a pre-need is simply funeral costs have historically doubled every ten years. There is all the carrots about controlling assets from the grave with trusts etc so if you care what happens after your dead you need to do more than buy insurance.</p>

    <!-- Long-Term Care Insurance -->
    <h2 class="pageTitle"><span class="pixel-arrow-style"></span>Long-Term Care Insurance</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>When my parents retired they paid a visit to me in Arizona. At the time I was still working in the Securities industry as a financial advisor. I suggested to them a Long-Term Care Policy. I simply explained to them you either die slow or fast. In today`s high tech health care that more often means dying slow hence the need for Long-Term Care Insurance.</p>

      <p>My parents were depression era poor kids growing up. My Father said they were going to skip that LTC stuff and we left it at that. I was never a high-pressure salesman and sure did not want to be one for my parents. They did not buy a Long-Term Care policy and we all lived to regret it.</p>

      <p>It started with my Mother`s sister passing away and while she never had the need for LTC her estate liquidation was rather labor intensive and time consuming. A Final Expense policy would have helped.</p>

      <p>My Brother followed who was some 11 years younger than I. He contracted Frontal Temporal Dementia (FTD). Without any insurance whatsoever it was an eight-year battle that almost bankrupted our whole family. A side note, for those that would like to dismantle and eliminate all welfare programs the bottom line here is if we would not have eventually got my Brother on Social Security Disability our family would have gone bankrupt. Age may not matter you never know for sure when you are going to need LTC or Final Expense insurance.</p>

      <p>My Father followed with a different type of dementia and could no longer walk and my Mother could no longer take care of him. I remember the phone call when she called me to come help and declared,</p>

      <p><strong>“Boy, do I wish we would have purchased that LTC policy when you presented it to us”</strong></p>

      <p><strong>The above example shows Why you plan for long-term care?</strong></p>

      <p>Deciding to buy LTC is kind of like buying auto tires, not too many people get to excited about it. It is just another paradox of insurance you may never need it but if you do it would be the most important thing in your life. If you don't ever need it and it is a stand-alone policy its kind of use it or lose it.  However, its not a cash back reward you paid for the insurance.</p>

      <p>If you buy LTC through a hybrid insurance policy you are buying whole life insurance and any LTC benefit will decrease your cash value. So, in other words if you bought the policy for relatives to have cash available to them upon your death the actual cash available may not be there in whole if used for LTC. Nonetheless, a hybrid insurance policy solves the stand-alone policy use it or lose it issue. Remember, long-term care benefits in a hybrid insurance policy are not as good with a stand-alone traditional long-term care policy  In addition with hybrid insurance you are paying the insurance company to bundle the two types of insurance for you.</p>

      <p>Often it is easier to qualify for a hybrid Insurance policy than a stand-alone long-term care policy if you're older. Underwriting is not so strict., premiums will be lower if you're younger and in good health. It is imperative whether you buy a hybrid insurance policy or a stand-alone LTC policy don't wait untill you already need it.</p>

      <p>Long-Term Care policies have elimination periods you choose. The longer the elimination period (how long you pay for LTC before benefits kick in) reduces the premium. Stand-alone LTC usually has up to 90-day elimination periods while hybrid policies can be as far out as 2 years. Also, Hybrid policies may not have inflation protection which is now fairly standard in stand alone LTC.</p>

      <p>If you have permanent life insurance policy with cash value you might be able to convert it to a hybrid policy using a 1035v exchange. In addition to the LTC benefit you are buying more insurance.</p>

      <p>The same is true for Critical or Chronic Illness riders on hybrid insurance policies. Monies used for this events come out of your death benefit. There is no free lunch. Hybrid policies are not the best value for your dollars in obtaining LTC.</p>

      <strong>I believe a Stand-Alone LTC is the best choice for the larger percentage of consumers.</strong>

      <p>The younger you buy them the cheaper they cost. Hybrid Insurance Policies with LTC Riders are best purchased when you are young and accumulate cash value over you lifetime. I'm not a big fan of plunking down $50,000.00 - $100,000.00 and more on an insurance policy to pay for LTC. If your assets are enough to do this then that can work for you but most American's are not in that camp. Even when they are it's a distasteful way to spend money. The average stay in a nursing home is just under 4 years. Do the math before you plunk down those kind of funds. Some policies today can pay for in-home care for those that desire that.</p>

      <p><strong>Medicare will not pay for long-term care</strong>, which is assistance with what are called the <strong>activities of daily living</strong>. There is about 7 or them how many you cannot do is what triggers benefits in many policies. Some might still be triggered by simply the physician just saying you need it. If you qualify <strong>Medicaid will cover the cost of long-term care at home and in skilled nursing facilities</strong>. It currently is the primary payer in the nation for long-term care services. However, you must have limited income and assets to qualify for Medicaid. <strong>You may have to spend down your assets to qualify</strong> and if you do qualify it would most likely put you in a lower cost group home.</p>

      <p>That is what happened to my brother and at one point we had to change the group home he was living at do to the quality of care he was receiving at that group home. The group home completely changed personnel not only were they not taking care of him they were stealing his personal items like shoes.. Medicare nor Medicaid will put you in the best of assisted living or nursing care facilities for Long-Term care needs. Often, the facilities charge based on how much care the patient needs.</p>

      <p><strong>DON'T WAIT</strong></p>

      <p>The longer you wait to buy long-term care insurance, the more it will cost. Health problems can make it more costly or even impossible to get coverage. For example my brother already had  memory loss and he did not qualify. Some insurers require a physical exam or medical-record review; others only conduct telephone health interviews.</p>

      <p>If you are still working group policies can be affordable and helpful. Some of the  403b insurance heavy retirement plans with employers can provide LTC Benefits.</p>

      <p>Talk with our insurance agent who is authorized to sell policies from multiple companies. They can  present your options so you have a full understanding. It's really important to have an independent agent who doesn't have a commission centered interest in any one insurance company.</p>

      <strong>Do you want a policy that you can receive benefits for in home care?</strong>

    <!-- Term Insurance -->
    <h2 class="pageTitle"><span class="pixel-arrow-style"></span>Term Insurance</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Term life insurance is very simple and it is also much more affordable.</strong></p>

      <p>Term Life Insurance has one simple function. Protect your family from an unexpected death. Change cannot happen without inconvenience, not even from worse to better. There cannot be much of a bigger inconvenience than a death in the family.</p>

      <p>Whether you pay off the mortgage, keep the kids clothed and fed while growing up or just simply use as income till a better future arrives. What you have here is a financial safety mechanism over the term of the policy. It is a financial safety belt for the duration of the term policy.</p>

      <p>The Beneficiary will receive the agreed upon payout upon the death of the insured. Usually for somewhere between 10 -30 years.  You make the same payment every month, and if you die within that term, your beneficiaries will be able to file a claim to receive the agreed upon payout.</p>

      <p>At the end of the term, the coverage ends, but so will your payments. Hopefully your family will never need the death benefit. While it appears you got nothing back for your premiums the fact of the matter is the term policy performed its function of protecting your family from an unexpected loss.</p>

    <!-- Fixed Annuities -->
    <h2 class="pageTitle"><span class="pixel-arrow-style"></span>Fixed Annuities</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>A fixed annuity</strong> is an insurance contract that guarantees (backed by the insurance companies ability to pay) payments to the buyer at an agreed upon guaranteed interest rate on contributions to the account.</p>

      <p><strong>A variable annuity</strong> pays interest that can fluctuate based on the performance of an investment portfolio chosen by the account's owner typically in mutual funds.</p>

      <p><strong>We don't sell variable annuities. See Y we don't sell variable insurance products.</strong></p>

      <p>The gains with a fixed annuity are tax deferred until the owner begins receiving income from the annuity. One can buy a fixed annuity with a lump sum of money or with a series of payments over time. The insurance company provides a guaranteed rate of interest. This time frame is called the period.</p>

      <p>When the annuity owner, called the annuitant, starts to receive regular income from the annuity, the insurance company bases those payments on the amount of money in their account, an owner's age, and the period of time the payments will last. This begins the payout period. The payout period might  last for a specified number of years or it could be for the rest of the owner's life. The owner has a myriad of payout options <strong>full annuitization</strong> is only one.</p>

      <p>The rest of your life period is called a full annuitization. In the old days they used to say every time an annuity was annuitized a cannon went off on the front lawn of the insurance company as they won the battle. The basis of that is full annuitization is a battle with the insurance company that you will live a long time and be paid in money's that exceed your contributions to the annuity/insurance company.</p>

      <p>Where with full annuitization if you die sooner the insurance company keeps what money's you left behind. Today, most people don't choose full annuitization. The simple reason is more people understand this and the fact of the matter is they do not know how long they will live. They don't like the idea of leaving money on the table for the insurance company. It is sort of like activating your Social Security. It's difficult as you don't know how long you are going to live.</p>

      <!-- <div class="photo">
        <img src="boom.png" width="50px" alt="">
      </div> -->

      <p>During the accumulation period, the account grows tax deferred. It is called the an exclusion ratio which is a fancy way of saying you do not pay taxes on what you contributed only on the gains the account accrued.</p>

      <p>However, in a qualified annuity,  annuities bought in a qualified retirement plan such as a 401K <strong>the entire payment would be subject to taxes</strong>. Because everything in the plan was already tax deferred!</p>

      <p>We do not believe in buying an annuity in a tax deferred account. While your legislators sell influence to the insurance industry to allow this it makes no sense. Any retirement plan that is qualified is tax deferred and set up for everything in the plan is already tax-deferred so you really don't need to have an annuity in such a plan.</p>

      <p>You can buy an annuity when you retire and start taking distributions from the plan for a guaranteed income for life but it is not recommended during the growth stage of your working career. While you have insurance agents masquerading as financial advisors our opinion is they are just insurance salespersons. A real (RIA) Registered Investment Advisor would probably not do this.</p>

      <p>Unlike life insurance fixed annuities are an investment and a very safe one at that. While the actual returns will not compete with stock market index returns over time they are on a par with safety much like a Government bond. In fact in today's inflation riddled environment and the huge debt the US Treasury has some might consider an insurance companies annuity safer than a Government. Bond.</p>

      <p>In our minds for risk-adverse investors a fixed  annuity makes more sense than a Government Bond. The US bond only pays interest through maturity but does not have any annuitization you simply get the interest accrued plus the price of the bond. However, it may not be the price you paid for the bond as bond prices go up when interest rates go down and bond prices go down when interest rates go up. So I that sense an annuity is safer than a government bond. One savvy mutual fund manager once said, If a money manager predicted interest rates correctly he was probably lucky.</p>

      <p>Keep in mind just in case of a recession / depression or even a reset in currency the insurance companies made it through the depression Wall Street did not. Also, it would be good to know what insurance companies failed in the 2008 great recession mortgage meltdown.</p>

      <p>An annuity is simple compared to buying stocks or bonds. You choose an insurance company first on their ability to pay. How long they have been In business, their rating, how they fared in 2008 and of course the interest rate they are guaranteeing.</p>

      <p><strong>DISADVANTAGES</strong></p>

      <p>Regardless of the annuities be it fixed or variable, they are mostly <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp">illiquid</a>. They allow one withdrawal per year of up to 10% of the account value. This may make them a bad choice for money that may be needed for an emergency. So, don't put your rainy-day emergency fund into an annuity.</p>

      <p>Annuities have a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/surrender-period.asp">surrender period</a>, which is the period that if you take too much money out in distributions you can see penalties and/or additional tax penalties depending on age.</p>

      <p>Annuities are an insurance product that can have higher fees compared to other investments. The only other investment to compare them to is Government Bonds. When it comes to safety there are not a lot of choices.</p>

      <p>CD's, Government treasuries / bonds and annutities. Gold is more illiquid and volatile.  Crypto was never a safe investment. An annuity is generally consider a very safe investment. If you would like to take a look contact us.</p>

    <!-- Fixed-Indexed Annuities -->
    <h2 class="pageTitle"><span class="pixel-arrow-style"></span>Fixed Indexed Annuity's</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>A fixed annuity is designed to hedge a stock market downturn or correction, or even a crash however defined. It is correct the protection a fixed-indexed annuity provides during those times doesn't make up for the opportunity cost of you missing out on the returns of longer bull markets. Without question stocks can significantly outperform investment returns of a fixed-indexed annuity.</p>

      <p>Fixed-indexed annuities offer investors a return based a specific market benchmark such as the Standard and Poor's. It is a given that the returns will not compete with stock market indexes in a bull market. That, however, is not what they were designed to do.</p>

      <p>They are for risk adverse investors who don't want to stomach the volatility of the stock market but would like to participate in potential better gains. It's an annuity so why would you expect to get stock market returns.</p>

      <p>Consider the stock market seems to crash at the  end of every generational spending wave. When the Henry Ford Generation retired, 1929. When the Bob Hope Generation retired in the late 70's early 80's the stock market crashed in an ugly inflationary recession.</p>

      <p>Now, the Boomers, the biggest generation yet is retiring. We don't know if we have already seen the recession from the Boomers retiring in 2008 or is it yet to come. In addition, the 100-year mark for the Great Depression is moving towards 2029. There is no guarantee that 100-year cycle will play out with a depression. Vision for what it will bring is for the prognosticators.</p>

      <p>One thing we do know is the Federal Reserve and Washington created a huge asset bubble in stocks, bonds and real estate. The Federal Reserve was protecting us from a depression and as a result protected real estate values out of the 2008 Great Recession. Between Quantitative easing (QE for short) means buying bonds to push up their prices bringing down long-term interest rates.</p>

      <p>Which some people call printing money as who's money were they buying the bonds with? QE plus the bailout for 2008 coupled with the bailout for the pandemic all created the biggest asset bubble in memory. With no recession/depression bringing prices down 60% or more of millennials may never be able to afford a home. Now, SCOTUS said they have to pay their student loans.</p>

      <p>Additionally we now see companies bragging about pricing power to their shareholders. The last time this happened was around 1929 when FDR put an end to it. His belief was there has to be a fair distribution of goods and services in the country and he brought reforms. Some of those reforms have been removed that is why 80% of local TV Stations are owned by one company now. I suppose they have some pricing power.</p>

      <p>So, while there are enough seeds for destruction no one knows for sure what will happen or when. But, for those that are in between 5 – 10 years to retirement a Fixed-indexed annuity can be a great choice.</p>

      <p>If there are significant market gains you can participate in some of that with a fixed-indexed annuity. If there is a market downturn or crash you have a guaranteed rate of return. Investment opportunities can only get better with increased risk.  A fixed-indexed Annuity is one of the few ways to protect your assets and still get better yields than a  savings account. All the other pros and cons of Annuities apply.</p>

    <!-- Final Expense Insurance -->
    <h2 class="pageTitle"><span class="pixel-arrow-style"></span>Final Expense Insurance</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Final expense insurance is often a *whole life insurance* policy that has a small death benefit and is easy to get approved for. It is often called funeral insurance, burial insurance, simplified issue whole life insurance, or modified whole life insurance. All relate to small whole life policies with a face value (and death benefit) of $2,000 to $35,000.</p>

      <p>However, you don’t have to buy whole life insurance to cover final expenses. You can simply pre-pay for final expenses while alive. It all depends on your assets and ability to access cash upon a death. We would never want to accuse the insurance industry of embellishment. The simple fact is whether you want to have a so-called traditional funeral or you choose to be cremated would probably determines whether you should buy Final Expense Insurance.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Average cost of a traditional embalmed burial and casket 
          $8,000.00 and up</li>
        <li>Average cost of a cremation should be under $2,000.00
          (have not accounted for recent inflation but ...)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I had my Brother, Father and Mother all cremated in Arizona for under $1500.00 each. My brother and father were significantly less. Other desires and costs determine what will be needed for Final Expenses.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What bills and expenses cannot be paid without additional monies</li>
        <li>What you will do with the Urn/Ashes.
          <ul>
            <li>Will/Can you dump them in their requested place</li>
            <li>Will you bury the Urn/Ashes in a cemetery costing a plot</li>
            <li>Will you have a Tombstone in the cemetery</li>
            <li>Do you want anyone to have a few extra bucks upon your death.</li>
            <li>Would someone be needed for estate liquidation.</li>
            <li>Are you a hoarder leaving much to be cleaned up and sold.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Lots of other choices running up the cost like you can have the ashes poured into the Grand Canyon for under a $1,000.00 (last time I checked).</p>

      <p>Add all that up and that is the amount needed for Final Expense. You can pay for all  that with a Final Expense Policy.</p>

      <p>Be careful here as there are what I consider predatory companies in this business. One of my relatives passed away with a pre-paid policy that included a box to put the urn in at a very excessive price. I had to threaten the company with a fraud lawsuit to get them to cancel the like policy for the spouse. It was just plain excessive. They prey on older people who don"t have a full understanding of all their options.</p>

      <p>Long-Term Care Insurance is like tires, nobody gets excited about going shopping for those things. Additionally, LTC provides a benefit while you are living where Final Expense Insurance benefits are after your dead so the real benefit is to your family or whoever will bury or cremate you.</p>

      <p>A large percentage of Final Expense Insurance is for people who say they don't want to dump all that on their kids both for stress and cost even if they are leaving a nest egg behind.</p>

      <p>When one of my relatives Son died in New York while they lived in Florida they had to decide to just leave his body dumping the cost of burial on the State of NY taxpayers or pony up for the cost to go get him and take care of it themselves. They chose the latter. Needless to say, he did not have insurance of any kind.</p>

      <p>More and more people are choosing cremation probably due to the cost. As stated <strong>We can get you cremated for a reasonable sum probably under $1,500.00 whereas a traditional burial would cost $8,000.00 or more</strong>. You can save some by not embalming but that depends on your States rules as States make you bury them within a certain amount or hours/days after death if not embalmed.</p>

      <p>Cremation also removes much of the hassle of working with undertakers. You don't have to stress over coffins and other costs just a simple urn. Cremation also eliminates other problems with a traditional funeral.</p>

      <p>A real good read on this subject is</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“The American Way of Death” by Jessica Mitford</li>
        <li>“The American Way of Death “Revisited”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may be able to buy these books used and cheap at <a href="https://estatesal.com">https://estatesal.com</a></p>

      <p>The book sums up an incident where a woman's husband died, and she had her sister make the funeral arrangements due to her grief. The sister picked out a reasonable priced coffin only to have the undertaker call her back later saying that the coffin would not work for her sister's husband as he was too tall to fit in it. A disagreement began and ended with the undertaker simply saying to the sister, ok we can use that coffin, but I will have to cut his feet off!</p>

      <p>While this may be unusual it shows there are a lot more hassles with a traditional funeral. For instance, historically it is recommended you do not bury relatives with their jewelry. If you decide to do that make sure you watch the undertakers close the coffin and follow it to the grave full of dirt.  It is alleged undertakers have some of the finest jewelry collections.</p>

      <p>So clearly, what kind of Final Expense policy you buy is dependent on cremation or burial.</p>

      <p>Final Expense does not have to be done with insurance although there are advantages of doing so. One can just do pre-need basically just paying for your cremation while you are alive. The rationale of doing this is that funeral costs have historically doubled every 10 years. This usually means you want to save your relatives money and stress.</p>

      <p><strong>We can do that for you we probably have the lowest cost cremation provider available in Arizona</strong></p>

      <p>You just pick out an urn and pay for it.. Now having done that you need to decide what you want done with your ashes and do you want a service. For those that are inclined you can still have a service and view the body prior to cremation. You can have your ashes flown up in an airplane and dumped in the Grand Canyon for a very hefty price. The price being almost as much as the cost of cremation.</p>

      <p>However, if you are going to have the ashes buried in a cemetery you will have to pay for the burial plot and then for course if you want a tombstone too you will have to pay for that.</p>

      <p>Take out an insurance policy for about $3,000.00 it could take care of the cremation and urn and leave about $1,500.00 for other expenses. This would most likely be a Whole Life Policy. Term insurance is not an option. If you are that close to death you probably should just go pre-need.</p>

      <p>If you are going with a traditional burial funeral then take out an insurance policy for $10,000.00. It should cover the cost of a reasonable funeral.  But if you love your relatives don't burden them with the stress and cost.</p>

      <p><strong>We can align you with one of the lowest cost cremation providers in the State of Arizona. Contact us.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>What we do for Final Expense (more or less my elevator speech)</strong></p>

      <p>We help people alleviate some common fears and misconceptions related to planning and funding one's own final expense costs.</p>

      <p>We help solve retirement and end-of-life challenges facing Americans today showing people how to spare your family the financial burden of paying for a funeral.</p>

      <p>We show people a way there family will not be remembering you for leaving a financial burden for the family so you can be memorialized under your own terms allowing family and friends the opportunity to honor a loved one.</p>

      <p>We remove the stress of a financial burden on relatives from final expenses.</p>

      <p>As a debt collector during bear markets it was not that unusual to have someone tell you they could not pay the bill as they just forked over some $8,000.00 for a relatives funeral.</p>

      <p><strong>Everybody leaves something behind. What will you leave?</strong></p>

      <p>Mr. Attwell is a Retired Stockbroker / Financial Advisor of 30 years. Actively sells Life Insurance, Final Expense insurance and Long-Term Care insurance. His attention is focused on the clients’ needs and benefits exclusively. He does not consider Life Insurance an investment rather it is a hedge against a possible unexpected loss. KISS is the philosophy.</p>

      <p>As you can see I have whiskers which means I have had first hand living experiences of why we buy and need life insurance. My Brother 11 years younger than I had an eight-year battle with Frontal Temporal Dementia (FTD). What that experience tells me is a simple life insurance policy can make the difference in bankruptcy and solvency for families. Just as important it also relieves your loved ones of responsibility and stress. A very simple low-cost plan can make a huge difference for the loved ones you leave behind.</p>

      <p>Everyone leaves something behind. What will you leave?</p>

      <p>"Our lives are not our own.<br />
        From womb to tomb, we are bound to others.<br />
        Past and present.<br />
        And by each crime and every kindness,<br />
        we birth our future."<br />
